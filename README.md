***I styled my backgroun as an image instead of a solid background color , as well as my modal cards and employee cards. I also made the color of the employee text be light so you CAN NOT see the employee city, state, & email unless you hover over them. I added a search bar but it does not work as well as next & previous buttons.

Communicating with APIs allows you to work with microservices and with vast databases to build useful tools and relevant information quickly and easily. You can build utilities, games, infographics, and more. You can also integrate, display, and analyze social media and large data sets without having to create and curate them yourself.

For this project,  build an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

Use the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

Request a JSON object from the API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.

Demonstrate your incredible skills, which will now include working with public APIs, making API requests, and asynchronously handling the data that will be returned from your requests and displayed in an app.
